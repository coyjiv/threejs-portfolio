    description: "The client aimed to revamp their styling web application, which was initially built in Ruby. Their primary goal was to enhance the appâ€™s functionality, improve performance, and fix existing bugs. They wanted to incorporate new features such as a chat system, booking system for styling sessions, and an efficient user account creation and feedback collection mechanism. They also aimed to enhance user experience and engagement on the platform. As a developer, I took the initiative to completely rewrite the application, transitioning it from Ruby to Next.js. I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, which allowed for a more modern and responsive design. I implemented Redux for state management to ensure smoother user interactions and data flow within the application. To bolster the backend, I integrated Firebase, which streamlined user authentication and data storage processes. I also engineered a real-time chat system, allowing users to communicate effortlessly. To streamline the booking of sessions with stylists, I integrated the app with Calendly. Additionally, I employed Typeform for an efficient user account creation process, and for collecting invaluable feedback, thereby elevating the user onboarding experience.",
